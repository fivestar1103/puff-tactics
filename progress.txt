[2026-02-14] US-001: Added core constants and signal bus scripts, registered both as autoload singletons in project.godot, and updated PRD pass state.
[2026-02-14] US-002: Added BattleMap.tscn with TileMapLayer and implemented battle_map.gd for isometric terrain rendering, per-cell terrain data/effects, and dictionary+JSON map loading for procedural configs; updated PRD pass state.
[2026-02-14] US-003: Added PuffData resource schema with element affinity multipliers, created Puff.tscn + puff.gd for tilemap-positioned placeholder puffs, defined six base puff resource presets (Cloud/Flame/Droplet/Leaf/Whirl/Star), and validated scripts/resources via headless Godot checks.
[2026-02-14] US-004: Implemented turn_manager.gd with clean player_select/player_action/enemy_action/resolve transitions, side-based turn order, tap-driven puff selection, highlighted movement range, move and attack actions, and resolve/advance flow; added TurnBattle.tscn to wire BattleMap with playable turn interactions; validated runtime phase progression headlessly and re-ran Godot --check-only across all src/scripts .gd files.
[2026-02-14] US-005: Added battle bump_system.gd and integrated bump actions into turn_manager.gd for player/enemy turns, including adjacency-based push direction, chain bumps, cliff-fall 1-turn stun removal/recovery, and animated push/fall feedback; verified chain+cliff bump outcomes with a headless runtime script and re-ran Godot --check-only on all src/scripts .gd files.
[2026-02-14] US-006: Added ai/enemy_intent.gd and wired it into TurnBattle.tscn to render ghosted enemy intent overlays (move arrows, attack target highlights, skill-area previews). Refactored TurnManager to expose get_enemy_intent_snapshot() and execute enemy turns from the same intent plan for display/action parity. Verified all src/scripts .gd files with Godot --check-only and validated reactive intent recalculation via a headless runtime scenario after board-state changes.
[2026-02-14] US-007: Added ai/utility_ai.gd and integrated it into TurnManager so each enemy now evaluates legal wait/move/attack/skill actions and selects the highest utility score using weighted factors (attack value, survival risk, positional advantage, bump opportunity). Exposed AI weight multipliers as TurnManager exports for difficulty tuning, preserved intent-execution parity by reusing the same planning path for get_enemy_intent_snapshot(), and validated behavior with headless Godot syntax checks plus runtime checks for intent utility fields and action scoring.
